# React To-Do App

A simple and responsive **To-Do App** built with **React.js**. This app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with features like task creation, editing, and categorization, all while ensuring persistent data storage using the browser's **local storage**.

## Features

- **Task Creation & Editing**:  
   Easily add new tasks, and modify existing ones to suit your needs.
   
- **Categorization**:  
   Tasks can be marked as **complete** or **incomplete**, and the app provides a dedicated section to view and toggle between the statuses.

- **Persistent Storage**:  
   The app stores tasks in **local storage**, ensuring that the tasks persist even after the page is reloaded or the app is closed.

- **Responsive Design**:  
   Fully responsive design that ensures the app works smoothly across various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

 - **Toast Notifications**:
  Provides feedback on actions like adding or deleting tasks.
